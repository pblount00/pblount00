# Hi, I'm Patrick — Full-Stack, Distributed Systems, & ML Engineer

I design, build, and deploy production-grade systems end-to-end:  
from real-time distributed pipelines, to cloud-hosted full-stack apps, to transformer-based ML workflows.

My work spans:
- **Full-stack engineering** (React, Angular, Firebase, GCP)
- **Distributed systems & backend architecture** (RabbitMQ, .NET, microservices)
- **Machine learning engineering** (Transformers, summarization, OCR pipelines)
- **Operations, monitoring, observability** (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager)

I love solving real problems with clean architectures, scalable workflows, and strong reliability guarantees.
